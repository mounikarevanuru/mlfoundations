# Machine Learning Foundations

This repo isn’t a full tutorial or a library. It’s my personal reference — a place where I experiment with concepts, write small examples, and connect theory with practice. Each file or notebook is something I’ve used to really understand how machine learning works, rather than just running pre-made libraries.

What’s Inside

**Data Handling**: preprocessing, normalization, feature engineering

**Basic Models**: linear and logistic regression, decision trees

**Evaluation**: loss functions, accuracy, train-test splits

**Optimization & Regularization**: gradient descent, learning rates, overfitting vs underfitting

**Foundational Ideas**: bias-variance tradeoff, general ML concepts

## How I Use It

I come back to this repo whenever I want to refresh my understanding of a concept or experiment with small examples. It’s my personal keepsake for all the foundational ideas I need to really understand ML. You can explore, run the code, or use it as inspiration for your own learning journey.

## Philosophy

Machine learning is more than just models and libraries, it’s about understanding the logic behind them. This repo helps me see the “why” and “how” of ML in a simple, hands-on way.
